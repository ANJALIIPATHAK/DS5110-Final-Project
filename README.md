## Description of the Problem 
According to a September 24 report by the Associated Press, obesity rates in the United States remain high and stable, with approximately 40% of the population affected, based on a 2021-2023 survey of  around 6,000 individuals. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveys demonstrate that nearly one in ten participants reported experiencing severe obesity. Given obesity's strong association with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and a reduced quality of life, weight loss is a significant concern for many. Achieving a calorie deficit to reduce body fat involves both dietary management and increased energy expenditure, making the gym an ideal choice for those aiming to improve their health.

This project aims to predict calorie expenditure based on exercise data collected from gym members. Understanding calorie burn is essential for designing effective workouts and helping individuals meet their fitness and weight management goals. By accurately predicting calories burned during specific exercises, personalized training plans can be developed, potentially enhancing health outcomes for gym-goers. Therefore, the key question is “how precisely can calorie expenditure be predicted from gym members' exercise data?”
## Summary of the Data 
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains detailed information on gym members' exercise routines, including features such as age, gender, height, weight, heart rate, and various exercise-related parameters such as intensity and duration. This dataset comprises 973 rows and 15 features, and provides a basis to understand the relationships between these factors and calorie burned. 

Key considerations in this analysis include addressing multicollinearity and data scarcity. Variables like heart rate and intensity may show strong correlations with calories burned, potentially leading to multicollinearity and impact model stability. To mitigate this, we will apply Principal Component analysis to reduce dataset dimensionality if necessary. Additionally, we plan to enhance the dataset by sourcing relevant external data and creating new features, such as classifying BMI to determine obesity levels and combining existing features. If additional data cannot be obtained, we will use the Synthetic Data Generation and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to generate synthetic samples. This approach will help balance the dataset and ensure the model is trained on a more diverse and representative sample.
## Methods 
The project focuses on predicting calorie expenditure using exercise parameters. To start, we will apply one-hot encoding to convert multi-categorical features into binary classifications, and utilize different prediction models. Planned methods include linear regression for baseline comparisons, and more advanced models such as Extreme Gradient Boosting(XGB), Neural Networks(multi-layer perceptron) and AutoML pipeline to improve accuracy. 

With advanced models such as MLP and XGBoost, there is a risk of overfitting, especially if the dataset size remains limited. Regularization, cross-validation, and fine tuning of model parameters will be necessary to prevent the model from learning noise rather than meaningful patterns. Moreover, these advanced methods may yield high accuracy but can be challenging to interpret. This lack of interpretability can limit the ability to draw clear insights into which exercise parameters most influence calorie expenditure. Therefore, we will do some visualizations before fitting models.
## Preliminary Results 
By fitting the linear regression model with the original data, the preliminary results of calorie burn prediction indicate a strong fit with an R-squared value of 0.98, meaning that 98% of the variance in calorie expenditure can be explained by this baseline model. Additionally, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 1413.62 highlights a relatively low prediction error.
